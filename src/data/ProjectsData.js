  Description: "Gaia is the name of the Cosmos SDK application for the Cosmos Hub. The Cosmos Hub is the first of thousands of interconnected blockchains that will eventually comprise the Cosmos Network. The primary token of the Cosmos Hub is the ATOM, but the Hub will support many tokens in the future. The role of a Hub is to facilitate transfers between blockchains. If a blockchain connects to a Hub via IBC, it automatically gains access to all the other blockchains that are connected to it.",

    Description: "Cosmos solves today's hardest blockchain problems. Cosmos is a decentralized network of independent parallel blockchains, each powered by BFT consensus algorithms like Tendermint consensus. In other words, Cosmos is an ecosystem of blockchains that can scale and interoperate with each other. Before Cosmos, blockchains were siloed and unable to communicate with each other. They were hard to build and could only handle a small amount of transactions per second. Cosmos solves these problems with a new technical vision. In order to understand this vision we need to go back to the fundamentals of blockchain technology.",
